To UI Team,

As we begin our work on the hospital management system project, our first task is to develop the home page, which will include the register and login functionality.

Task Overview:
Each of you is required to create a short document detailing the features you will implement and outlining your approach to development. This document should cover the following:

Features:

Description of the home page layout.
Details of the registration form, including fields and validation.
Details of the login form, including fields and validation.
Development Approach:

A step-by-step plan on how you will proceed with the development.
Any specific technologies or libraries you plan to use.
Considerations for ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.

Commit the documentations once you make a plan
