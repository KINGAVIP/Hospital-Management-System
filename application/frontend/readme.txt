To UI Team,

As we begin our work on the hospital management system project, our first task is to develop the home page, which will include the register and login functionality.

Task Overview:
Each of you is required to create a short document detailing the features you will implement and outlining your approach to development. This document should cover the following:

Features:

Description of the home page layout.
Details of the registration form, including fields and validation.
Details of the login form, including fields and validation.
Development Approach:

A step-by-step plan on how you will proceed with the development.
Any specific technologies or libraries you plan to use.
Considerations for ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.

Commit the documentations once you make a plan
The frontend of the Hospital Management System is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a responsive and user-friendly design. It provides tailored interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators:

Patient Portal: Simplified navigation for booking appointments, viewing medical history, and updating profiles.
Doctor Portal: A personalized dashboard for managing schedules, appointments, and accessing patient records.
Admin Dashboard: Tools for efficiently managing hospital resources, schedules, and user accounts.
JavaScript adds interactivity, such as real-time form validation and dynamic appointment booking, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.
