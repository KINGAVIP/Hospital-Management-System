# Hospital-Management-System

## Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a collaborative project developed by our team for CodeFurry Competition. Our goal was to create an efficient, user-friendly application to manage hospital operations, focusing on enhancing the experience for users, admins, doctors, and patients. The system is designed to streamline appointments, manage schedules, and handle various administrative tasks.

## Team Approach

Our team followed an agile methodology, working in sprints to deliver key functionalities for each domain. We divided the project into two main parts: **Frontend** and **Backend**.

### Team Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Frontend Developers:**
   - Responsible for designing the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Ensured that the UI is responsive, user-friendly, and aligned with the project’s theme.
   

2. **Backend Developers:**
   - Developed the business logic using Java and handled data storage with MySQL.
   - Focused on security, data integrity, and scalability.

3. **Design and Documentation:**
   - Produced detailed design documents including ER diagram, UML diagram, class Diagram and use case diagrams.
   - Created comprehensive test cases and ensured that all functionalities were rigorously tested.
   - Prepared a presentation (PPT) to showcase the project, highlighting its features and technical aspects.

4. **Project Management:**
   - Managed the project timeline, ensuring that all milestones were met on schedule.
   - Monitored progress and adjusted the project scope as needed to align with hackathon goals.

### Development Process

1. **Initial Planning:**
   - Brainstormed and identified the core features necessary for a hospital management system.
   - Divided the work into modules (User, Admin, Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Schedule) and assigned responsibilities.

2. **Design Phase:**
   - Created design documents to serve as blueprints for development.
   - Established a consistent visual style and user experience for the frontend.

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Developed the frontend using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, creating a clean and intuitive interface.
   - Implemented the backend with **Java and MySQL**, focusing on robust business logic and secure data management.

4. **Testing and Integration:**
   - Conducted unit and integration testing to verify that all components work as intended.
   - Fixed bugs and optimized performance based on testing results.
   - Performed user acceptance testing to ensure the system meets end-user needs.

5. **Final Presentation:**
   - Compiled all deliverables, including design documents, test cases, and the application source code.
   - Created a PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate the project, highlighting key features and technical challenges overcome.

## Project Features

### 1. **User Management:**
   - Registration and login functionality for users (patients and doctors).
   - Profile management with options to update contact details and other personal information.

### 2. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Comprehensive tools for managing hospital resources, including doctors and patients.
   - Schedule management, allowing admins to allocate doctor availability.
   - Appointment oversight, with options to modify or cancel bookings.

### 3. **Doctor Portal:**
   - Doctors can view their schedules, set availability, and manage appointments.
   - Access to patient records and history, aiding in informed treatment decisions.

### 4. **Patient Portal:**
   - Easy appointment booking with preferred doctors.
   - View and manage appointment history and upcoming visits.
   - Secure access to personal health records and treatment history.
